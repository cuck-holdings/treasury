# CUCK. Treasury

This repo keeps track of all of the CUCK. expenses and grants. Follow the
instructions below to submit an expense or grant applicaiton.

CUCK.'s purpose is to:

> Rebuke the church, cuck the state, and out compete big businesses with
> censorship resistant public goods

> We exist to reduce our collective reliance on committees, and cuck the
> remaining ones.

> Fuck the status quo. Fuck monopolies. Fuck committees. Fuck banks. Fuck token
> voting. Fuck alignment. Fuck number go up. Fuck maximalism. Fuck big
> companies.

One of the ways that it is helping this effort is to simply give away all of the
commission that is earned by the validator to grantees who are pursuing similar
goals.

The process for filing for an expense or grant is described in further detail
below.

## Applying for a Grant

To apply for a grant, make a PR to the appriate directory  in this repo
`./grants` witha a markdown file that follows the example format. It should
cover what is novel about your project, why its important (bonus points for not
being cringe), and lastly what and how much money is needed. If the amount of
money is flexible, please note that.

Some ideal grants are mentioned below, but these are not firm requirements.

### Funds to subsidize Deployment of a Novel or useful Rollup

There is an already built rollup that doesn't have a lot or any funding that wants to have gas money. Note that in these examples, funds won't actually be transfered to the grantee. Instead, funds will be set aside in an account that will grant `feegrant` access to the grantee's account(s).

### Implementation Grants

Funds to help pay for the development of a novel or experimental technology, especially ones that wouldn't otherwise get funded. Ideally the tech help push forward the values of CUCK.. Bonus points for based rollups, privacy tech, and gossiping improvements.

### Retrospective Research Grants

Retrospective Research Grants. There was already some well written and received research that helps cuck committees in some way (could be privacy tech!). Since the grant is retrospective, the goal of these grants is to help align the researcher with the rest of the Celestia ecosystem, and encourage others to build on the same research

### New Research Grants

Similar to the above, but for research that has yet to be done. Again, ideally this research directly contributes to the goals of CUCK..

### Audit of Relevant Open Source Work

Audits that help establish confidence in important opensource work. Again, ideally this research directly contributes to the goals of CUCK..

## Applying for an Expense

Expenses will alsmost exclusively be filed by the members of CUCK. who are
actually paying to run the hardware. For the time being, no expenses can be
filed that spend money on the time or effort it takes to run the validator.
Funds can only be expensed if there was a material costs to an individual
directly related to running the validator. These reports must include receipts
of some form.

Examples include paying for cloud services, or buying hardware to run the
validator or nodes relating to the validator. Ideally, expenses are almost
always pre-approved.
